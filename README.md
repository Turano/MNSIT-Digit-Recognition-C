# MNSIT-Digit-Recognition-C

Neural Network in plain C for digit recognition (from 0 to 9) using the MNSIT dataset converted to a .csv.
In order to use these files, extract all files from ./data/dataset.zip and compile ./main.c.

Future changes: 
  Rewrite it in a more modular and readable code.
  Show accuracy rating for different epochs as an example.
  Capacity to save and load weights.
  Create new types of activation function such as ReLu and SoftMax.
  Learn how to properly write a README and rewrite this.
